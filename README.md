> There is an app for everything

PlantEye is a mobile application designed for anyone who enjoys plants or is interested in nature. Identify plants, flowers, and trees by photo. Furthermore, scan your plant to determine its health status!

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

The application includes the following features:
1. User identification:
    - sign up & login
    - Reset password
    - View profile
2. Plant identification: This feature is based on the [Plant.id](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/) API, which uses machine learning to identify plant species. The user will be able to:
    - Identify plants based on their images
    - Add the plant to the "Save plants" collection
    - View or delete plant details, and add a note to a specific plant
    - Gain access to additional information about each plant
3. Plant disease diagnosis: The [Plant.id](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/) API can also diagnose disease. The user will be able to:
    - Identify the plant's health state based on its image
    - View more information about the disease
    - View the disease's diagnosis history
4. Articles: The app will include a variety of articles with farming and plant care tips.

## Wireframe

For the wireframe I used Figma, you can preview my work [here](https://www.figma.com/file/aWkuGfhZ6abgWSeHs2HLQ5/Capstone-3---Plant-identifier?node-id=308%3A769)!

## Planning and Development Process 

Every good application requires a plan to meet the app specifications and requirements of the user. My strategy was as follows:

1. Brain storming and wirefram design.
2. Front-end: XML design in Android Studio.
3. Back-end:
    - Firebase Database
    - Plant.id API
5. Testing including unit testing

I started by brainstorming ideas for the app requirements, and then I looked at different apps in the Google Play store to get a better understanding of the app workflow. Then, I provided my application with a proper name and a logo. After that, I used Figma to create the app interfaces.

During the development process, I tested the API in Postman to ensure that it functioned properly. Then, in Android Studio, I started with the XML design for the UI. After that, I moved on to the backend, beginning with the API, followed by the Firestore repo, and finally implemented the functionalities.
